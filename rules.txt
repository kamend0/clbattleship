the goal of battleship is to sink your opponent's ships.

in this simplified version of battleship, one person positions their ships, then the other orders strikes to sink them.

each player begins with a score of 17. (this is equal to the number of spaces taken up by all battleships in play.)

player 1 (the striker) inputs coordinates to strike. if they miss, they lose a point; if they hit a ship, they gain a point.

player 2 (the concealer) chooses the positions of ships at the start of the game. for every shot player 1 misses, player 2 (the concealer) gains a point. for every successful strike on a ship, they lose a point.
